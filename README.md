# Tasklist
This is a simple task list app - you can log in, create/edit/delete a list, and create/edit/delete tasks as you see fit. This was created so that I could learn Angular and Angular Material. I also wanted to learn more about NoSQL databases and asynchronous functions.

# Technologies
This is a FAN stack app (Firebase, Angular, Node).

Note: It will take a few seconds to boot up the server since it is hosted on Heroku's free hosting tier.
